# TCP-Trigger-Request
This is an example how a one-way TCPIP Request can be fired from a HTTPS page to an HTTP resource.

This approach is very useful for example for IoT systems where there is no direct access to a system and no SSL certificate is installed on the embedded local web server.

For an explanation see the Medium blog story [Oneway Request from HTTPS to HTTP without Errors](https://medium.com/@ebakhtarov/oneway-request-from-https-page-to-http-resource-without-errors-4927b367d77c)
